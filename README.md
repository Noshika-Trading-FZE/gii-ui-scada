# GII UI Scada

Gii SCADA is the main application of the whole Gii suite which is aimed at visualizing the IT/IOT infrastructure for the particular deployment with all required specifics to monitor and control its functionality and operations. Gii SCADA is built on top of the concept of the objects which is the core data representation entity within the whole platform. Each object can be visualised on the map at specific place with the help of powerful customization tools, like custom icons, colors, names, coordinates and cetera. Object properties can be used to trigger alarms and alerts, which can be delivered to the interested users with the system or can be integrated with external messaging system. Workplace can be enriched with custom maps, floor plans or background pictures to help IT/IOT managers or other end users to feel comfortable while working with or monitoring the operations of the system.
